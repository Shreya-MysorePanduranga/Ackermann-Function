This was the mini project of EEDG/CE 6370: Design and Analysis of Reconfigurable Computing Systems, which i took in Spring 2021 semester. The project was to implement Ackermanâ€™s function in hardware and compare performance with software using the Zynq device on the Zybo board.
The software code is pretty straightforward and measuring runtime requirements for software was easy. For hardware-based computation, the runtime is estimated based on number of clock cycles that are needed to complete the task.
A detailed report of the design and analysis is uploaded which include details about analysis, design, and implementation of both the functions in hardware.
